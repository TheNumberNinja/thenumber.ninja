                  Whether you're looking for someone to manage your business finances, or just a helping hand to make sure you're
                  on the right track, The Number Ninja can help. I'm a lover of technology and use a number of
                  systems to help me provide a great service remotely, from the lovely cathedral city of Ely in Cambridgeshire,
                  whilst remaining fully connected to you and your business. You'll also have access to my client dashboard where, amongst other things,
                  you can see important dates for your business, such as when your VAT return is due.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As well as providing current information on the performance of your business, up-to-date and accurate bookkeeping
                  can greatly reduce the amount of time required to prepare things like your self assessment return. For limited companies, I can also prepare your annual accounts for submission to HMRC and Companies House.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When youâ€™re running a business, the finance side of things is often the one area that falls down the list of
                  priorities as dealing with your accounts can be scary, even when things are going well! A good way of ensuring
                  that you always have current financial knowledge, without taking your time away from what you do best, is to outsource
                  your bookkeeping and accounts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It can be scary working with an accountant, I know that. You don't know what hard questions we're going to ask, and a quick look at the HMRC website is enough to tell you that we speak a whole different language.
